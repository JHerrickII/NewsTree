## About

Data is everywhere.

With massive amounts of data coming from several outlets and businesses striving hard to pick out the bits that matter, understanding big data has become an integral part of the success of industries worldwide.

One of these industries is News. Thousands of news stories are published each day. And within these articles are millions of connected concepts and relationships that are not as obvious. There is value in being able to organize and structure the news. And the "NewsTree" project exists to serve that purpose: a visual supplement to the understanding of news articles. Using IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding services, you are able to generate intuitive and responsive knowledge trees that depict the relationship between each major concept in your article.

Using summary algorithms, users may view a complete summarization of news articles.

As well, you have the option to delve deeper in your exploration of the news by viewing the most recent and relevant news stories through Watson Discovery services.

See "How To Use" below.

## How To users

Paste a link to any news article URL into the text box. Alternately, you may uncheck the "Search URL" checkbox to analyze plaintext directly.

Then, click on the "Summary and Relations Outline" button for a comprehensive summary of the article and a listing of every relationship contained in the article story.

You may also click the "Knowledge Graph Representation" button to view a knowledge tree of all of the listed relationships. Graph nodes are responsive to user clicks to expand showing the type of relationship. Click on a terminal node to do a Discovery search for more related articles.
